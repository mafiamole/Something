== Welcome to Battleships Game(I run it on Ubuntu)
I use Postgresql for the database because I am comfortable with it.
I use the following gems to do my testing:
  Rspec for normal testing. Fakeweb for mocking http://url.
  Vcr to record the needed requests.
  Simplecov to see the code coverage.
  Factory_Girl for the factories.
I used the stateflow gem for a state_flow_machine on some of the models.

How to run the app:
1. bundle install (to get all the gems)
2. rake db:create
3. rake db:migrate
4. rake db:seed ( there is some ship data in the seeds)
5. rails s

HELLO WORLD
